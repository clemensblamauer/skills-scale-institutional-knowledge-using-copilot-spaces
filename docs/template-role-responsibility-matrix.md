# Role-Responsibility Matrix Template

## Purpose
Use this RACI matrix to clarify who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for key project activities. This reduces ambiguity and ensures clear handoffs between roles.

## How to use
- **R (Responsible)**: Does the work to complete the task
- **A (Accountable)**: Ultimately answerable for completion and has decision authority (only one A per activity)
- **C (Consulted)**: Provides input and feedback (two-way communication)
- **I (Informed)**: Kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)
