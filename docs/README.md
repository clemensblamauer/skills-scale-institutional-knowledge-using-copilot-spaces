# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme organizes work around a clear, iterative lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective. Projects begin with a lightweight Project One-pager to capture the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders and a high-level timeline. Planning breaks approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, a Definition of Done, and a release plan. Execution uses a project board (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and small, focused pull requests that reference issues and acceptance criteria to keep work incremental and reviewable.

Core workflows emphasize predictable delivery and traceability. Backlog items follow a template (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, owner) and are pulled into timeboxed sprints or iterations during planning. The pull request workflow enforces CI (tests and linting), security scans, and at least one approval before merging; authors are encouraged to keep PRs small (<= 400 lines when possible). Releases are categorized (patch, minor, major) and require pre-release checks (passing CI, release notes, rollback plan), staged deployment with smoke tests, and post-deploy verifications.

Roles and responsibilities are explicitly mapped: Project Manager coordinates delivery, risk and communications; Product Manager defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog and measures success; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria; Stakeholders provide input and approvals. Communication cadence supports that structure with daily standups for blockers and progress, weekly delivery syncs to surface progress and risks, regular PM–PdM alignment, and monthly stakeholder updates. There are also defined escalation paths (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and incident communication templates for triage and post-incident follow-up.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout: unit and integration tests for new logic, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, CI-based security scanning, and manual QA when needed. Definition of Done and acceptance criteria are enforced during planning and code review. Risk management runs in parallel via a maintained Risk Register (ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation, status), regular review at weekly syncs, and a documented incident and rollback playbook to reduce production risk and accelerate recovery. Continuous improvement is closed-looped through retrospectives that produce prioritized action items tracked back into the project backlog.
